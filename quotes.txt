There are billions of people in the world, but there is only one you.
Tough times don't last, but tough people do.
Some of us think holding on makes us strong, but sometimes it is letting go.
Accepting your failures is the first step to fixing them.
Eat ass, smoke grass and live fast :))
Even in a world of darkness. There will always be a light to guide you through it you just have to find it.
Your anger is the fuel for your love and kindness within.
Making mistakes is part of life, but it's what you do after the mistake or failure that matters.
Be you, there is nothing better then you being you. Do not let anything stop you from expressing you opinion.
Kindness is not a virtue but a right.
Every grim day has an end, and that end will be filled with joy and happiness. there is always a end to the pain.
In the darkest of times, it helps to have someone who cares and wants to help.
When life pushes you down, you should push back harder.
There are People who care.
Don't give up, the world will twist and turn to push you down and try to get you down, just hang on you will make it.
Be your self you are amazing and creative when you stop trying to be someone else.
Please just be proud of your self. If not for the people you care about then at least for your self.
